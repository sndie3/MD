# MASTERCLASS — User Flow Guide
Masterclass Documentation

The system has two frontends:

| Frontend | URL entry point | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| **MasterClass** (Agent App) | `/login` | Agents (all levels) and players |
| **Backoffice** (Admin Dashboard) | `/features` | Masterclass admin / operators |

Both share the same FastAPI backend and SQLite database.

## PART 1 — MASTERCLASS (Agent Frontend)

### 1.1 Login & Authentication — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/login`
**What it does:** Agents sign in with their phone number and password. A checkbox confirms agreement to Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. On success, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.

**Example:**
> An agent opens the app, enters `09123456789` and `MyPass123`, ticks the agreement box, and taps **Login**. They land on the Dashboard.

**Related page:** `/reset` — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**What it does:** Allows an agent to reset their password if they forgot it. Currently shows "Password reset is not connected yet." The form collects mobile number, new password, confirm password, and OTP, but no backend API exists for password reset or OTP generation.

---

### 1.2 Dashboard (Home) — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/dashboard`
**What it does:** The main hub after login. Shows the agent's username, verification status, and a grid of menu icons that navigate to all agent-facing features.

**Menu items on the Dashboard:**

| Icon | Label | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add Level | Add Level | `/add-level` | Create a sub-agent (child) |
| Earnings | Earnings | `/earnings` | View earnings and request withdrawals |
| Send icon | Credit Send | `/credit-send` | Manage credit requests from child agents |
| Ribbon | Promos | `/promo` | View promotional offers |
| Register | Register | `/register` | Register a new player |
| Settings | Settings | `/settings` | Open settings menu |
| Support | Support | `/support` | Open support chat |

**Sidebar (hamburger menu):** Opens a side panel with:
- **Profile** → `/profile`
- **Notification** → `/notifications`
- **Privacy** (placeholder)
- **Settings** → `/settings`
- **Promos** → `/promo`
- **Install** (PWA install prompt, if available)
- **Sign Out** — logs out and returns to `/login`

---

### 1.3 Add Level (Create Sub-Agent) — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/add-level`
**What it does:** Allows an agent to register a child agent one level below themselves. The form collects first name, middle name, last name, mobile number, email, birthdate, password, and a selfie-with-ID photo (camera or file upload). A username and UID are auto-generated. The child agent's level is automatically set to the parent's level + 1.

**Example:**
> A Level 2 agent named "ROGER" opens Add Level, fills in the form for a new agent "ALICE", takes a selfie with ID, and taps **Activate**. A Level 3 agent "ALICE" is created under ROGER's downline.

---

### 1.4 Register (Register a Player) — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/register`
**What it does:** Allows an agent to register a player under their account. The form collects first name, middle name, last name, mobile number, birthdate, password, and a selfie-with-ID photo (camera capture). On success, a player UID is returned.

**Example:**
> Agent ROGER registers a player named "JUAN" with mobile `09187654321`, takes a selfie with ID, and taps **Activate**. Player JUAN is created and linked to ROGER.

---

### 1.5 Earnings — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/earnings`
**What it does:** Displays the agent's real-time earnings split into two wallets: **Specialty** and **Standard**. Each wallet shows the current balance and a withdrawal button. Tapping a wallet opens a withdrawal modal where the agent enters an amount and submits a withdrawal request. A logs table appears below (currently empty/placeholder).

**Example:**
> Agent ROGER sees Specialty = 5,000 and Standard = 12,000. He taps the Standard wallet, enters 3,000, and taps **Submit Withdrawal**. A withdrawal request is sent to the backoffice for approval.

---

### 1.6 Credit Send — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/credit-send`
**What it does:** Shows a unified list of credit sends and credit requests from child agents. The agent can:
- **Approve** or **Disapprove** pending credit requests from children
- Mark requests as **Paid** or **Unpaid**
- Record a **Payment** for an agent (enter an amount and pay)
- View an **Unpaid Summary** showing each child agent's total owed and paid amounts
- View **Payment History** per agent

The page auto-refreshes every 500ms to show real-time updates.

**Example:**
> Agent ROGER sees a credit request from child agent ALICE for 1,000 Standard credits. He taps **Approve**, then later enters 500 in the payment box and taps **Proceed to Pay** to record a partial payment.

---

### 1.7 Profile — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/profile`
**What it does:** Displays the agent's full name, level, username, and UID. Shows editable email and contact fields. Provides navigation to:

| Menu Item | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Link Player Account | `/link-player-account` | Link an existing player to the agent |
| Selfie with ID / View ID | `/selfie-with-id` or `/view-id` | Submit or view the agent's selfie-with-ID |
| Share Referral Code | `/profile/share-referral` | Share the agent's referral code |
| Theme | `/theme` | Choose a visual theme |
| Change Password | `/change-password` | Change the agent's password |

**Sub-pages:**
- **Link Player Account** (`/link-player-account`) — ✅ WORKING — Links an existing player to the agent via `POST /api/player-link/`
- **Selfie with ID** (`/selfie-with-id`) — ✅ WORKING — Camera capture, uploads via `PUT /api/auth/selfie`
- **View ID** (`/view-id`) — ✅ WORKING — Fetches and displays the agent's selfie-with-ID from backend, with retake functionality
- **Share Referral Code** (`/profile/share-referral`) — ✅ WORKING — Fetches real account data and displays referral code
- **Change Password** (`/change-password`) — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED — Shows "Password reset is not connected yet."

**Example:**
> Agent ALICE opens Profile, taps **Share Referral Code**, and sees her referral code `ALICE-ABC123` which she can share with prospective players.

---

### 1.8 Theme — ✅ WORKING (localStorage)

**Page:** `/theme`
**What it does:** Displays a carousel of 23 visual themes. The agent can swipe or use arrow keys to browse, tap **Activate** to apply a theme, or tap **Default** to reset. The selected theme changes the app's background, button, and card colors globally.

**Example:**
> Agent ROGER swipes to "Theme 5", previews it live, and taps **Activate**. The app's colors change immediately and persist across sessions.

---

### 1.9 Settings — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/settings`
**What it does:** A menu page linking to sub-settings:

| Option | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Profile Security | `/profile-security` | Security settings for the agent's profile |
| Chat Settings | `/chat-settings` | Customize chat appearance and behavior |
| Deactivate Account | `/deactivate-account` | Deactivate the agent's account |
| Licenses | `/licenses` | View license information |
| System License | `/system-license` | View system license details |

#### Deactivate Account (`/deactivate-account`) — ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
Clears localStorage and redirects to login, but does **not** call any backend API to actually deactivate the account. The account remains active in the database — the user can simply log back in.

#### Profile Security (`/profile-security`) — ✅ WORKING (localStorage)
Toggle switches for Session Logout, End-to-End Encryption, Location, Biometric Login, Device Identification, Profile Encryption, and Auto Update. All stored in localStorage.

#### Change Password (`/change-password`) — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
Shows "Password reset is not connected yet." The form collects mobile number, new password, confirm password, and OTP, but no backend API exists for password changes or OTP verification.

#### Chat Settings (`/chat-settings`) — ✅ WORKING (localStorage)
Sub-options:
- **Change Chat Name** (`/change-chat-name`) — ✅ WORKING (localStorage) — Change the display name in chat
- **Chat Wallpaper** (`/chat-wallpaper`) — ✅ WORKING (localStorage) — Choose a wallpaper for chat backgrounds
- **App Icon** (`/app-icon`) — ✅ WORKING (localStorage) — Choose a custom app icon
- **Show 21+ Content** toggle — ✅ WORKING (localStorage) — Show/hide adult content media
- **Direct Share** toggle — ✅ WORKING (localStorage) — Show/hide share app link

---

### 1.10 Notifications — ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING

**Page:** `/notifications`
**What it does:** Manage notification preferences. Two sections — **Promo** and **Support** — each with three toggles: Email, SMS, and Notification (in-app). Toggling switches them on/off.

**What's missing:** Toggle state is stored in React state only — it resets on page reload. No localStorage persistence and no backend API to save preferences.

**Example:**
> Agent ROGER turns off SMS notifications for Promo but keeps Email and in-app notifications on. However, if ROGER navigates away and returns, all toggles reset to their defaults (all on).

---

### 1.11 Support — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Page:** `/support`
**What it does:** A support chat interface with two tabs: **Affiliate** and **Players**. The agent can view support messages and type a message to send. The chat background uses the selected chat wallpaper.

**What's missing:** All messages are hardcoded dummy data ("Message ni boss..." with fake timestamps). The send button has no API call — messages are not actually sent or stored. No backend support/chat API exists. The game carousel section is commented out.

---

### 1.12 Customer Support — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Page:** `/customer-support`
**What it does:** A dedicated customer support chat page accessible from the dashboard. Shows a chat interface with a welcome message and input field.

**What's missing:** Messages are stored in local React state only — they disappear on page reload. No backend API for chat messages. No real support agent on the receiving end. This is a UI-only prototype.

---

### 1.13 Promo — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Page:** `/promo`
**What it does:** Lists promotional offers as buttons: Sign Up Bonus, Player Cash-In Rebate, Hourly Promo, Discount Program, Daily Raffle, Weekly Raffle, Monthly Raffle, and Event.

**What's missing:** All buttons have empty `onClick={() => {}}` handlers — nothing happens when tapped. No backend API for promos. No promo details, images, or registration flow. This is a static UI placeholder only.

---

## PART 2 — BACKOFFICE (Admin Dashboard)

### 2.1 Features (Landing Page) — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/features`
**What it does:** The main landing page of the backoffice. Displays all features grouped by category in a card grid. Each card links to the corresponding feature page. A navigation bar at the top shows the "MASTERCLASS AGENT DASHBOARD" title and a **FEATURES** button to return to this page.

**Feature groups:**

1. Agents

---

### 2.2 Registration — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/registration`
**What it does:** Register a new agent. The form collects username, password, UID, first/middle/last name, contact, email, selfie-with-ID, level, scope (MASTERCLASS or DEFAULT), and referral code. Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, and a digit.

**Example:**
> Admin registers a new Level 1 MASTERCLASS agent named "CARLOS" with contact `09171112222`. The agent appears in the Registration List with status "HOLD" (pending).

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /api/agents/register`

### 2.4 Agent Tree — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/agent-tree`

### 2.5 Account Status — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/account-status`
**What it does:** View and manage approved agents split into **Online** and **Offline** tables. Each row shows rank, username, contact, standard earnings, specialty earnings, and total earnings. Search by username or contact. The admin can change an agent's account status to **BLOCK**, **HOLD**, or **ACTIVE**.

**Example:**
> Admin sees agent ROGER is online with 17,000 total earnings. Admin sets ROGER to "HOLD" due to a compliance issue — ROGER is immediately blocked from logging in.

---

### 2.6 Account Approval — ✅ WORKING

**Page:** `/approval`
**What it does:** Review pending agent accounts and approve or disapprove them. Approved agents can log in; disapproved agents are blocked.

In edit mode, the admin can use `+` / `-` buttons or a number input to add/remove levels. An **ONLINE** toggle controls whether the scope is active.

**Example:**
> Admin sets MASTERCLASS max level to 7 and DEFAULT max level to 2. Agents cannot create sub-agents beyond these levels. Admin toggles DEFAULT scope to ONLINE to activate it.

**Backend endpoints:** `POST /api/levels`, `PUT /api/levels/scope/{scope}/add`, `PUT /api/levels/scope/{scope}/remove`, `PUT /api/levels/scope/{scope}/online`

---

- **Set commission mode** per game (UNCONFIGURED, STATIC, EDITABLE, DYNAMIC)
- **Edit commission templates** — set percentage per agent level per scope (MASTERCLASS or DEFAULT)
- **Set per-agent commission overrides** — assign custom percentages to specific agents
- **Configure player commission** — set the player's commission percentage per game
- **Preview commission breakdown** — simulate a bet and see how commission is distributed across the upline chain

**Example:**
> Admin creates a BET game "Lotto" with code "lotto". Sets commission mode to "STATIC". Configures MASTERCLASS templates: Level 0 = 2.0%, Level 1 = 1.5%, Level 2 = 1.3%, etc. Player commission set to 0.2%. When a player bets 1,000 on Lotto, each agent in the upline receives their percentage.

**Backend endpoints:** `POST /api/commission/games`, `PUT /api/commission/config/{game_id}`, `PUT /api/commission/templates/{game_id}`, `PUT /api/commission/agent-settings/{game_id}`

---

### 2.13 Commission Monitor — ✅ WORKING

---

### 2.15 Paid Collection — ✅ WORKING

| # | Feature | What's needed |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Statistics** (Backoffice) | Frontend: Wire 5 hardcoded stats (Default Player, Non-Default Player, Withdrawal Request/Approved/Disapproved) to actual backend values. Backend already returns some of these. |
| 2 | **Notifications** (MasterClass) | Frontend: Persist toggle state to localStorage or backend API so preferences survive page reloads. |
| 3 | **Deactivate Account** (MasterClass) | Frontend: Call backend API to actually deactivate the account, not just clear localStorage. |
